#Introduction

* Lasso regressions performs best with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121. Given the fact that there is a lot of multicolinearity among the variables, this was expected. Lasso does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.
* The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162. 
* As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to improve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double.

#Introduction

Kaggle describes this competition as [follows](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques):

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.


# Loading and Exploring Data

##Loading libraries required and reading the data into R

Loading R packages used besides base R.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
library(caret)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(Rmisc)
library(GGally)
library(ggrepel)
library(randomForest)
library(psych)
library(xgboost)
```

Below, I am reading the csv's as dataframes into R fetching the dataset from my GitHub repo.

```{r}
train <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salma71/houses_prices_kaggle/master/datasets/train.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
test <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salma71/houses_prices_kaggle/master/datasets/test.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
head(test)
```

##Data size and structure

The train dataset consist of character and integer variables. Most of the character variables are actually (ordinal) factors, but I chose to read them into R as character strings as most of them require cleaning and/or feature engineering first. 

In total, there are 81 columns/variables, of which the last one is the response variable (SalePrice). Below, I am displaying only a glimpse of the variables. All of them are discussed in more detail afterwords.

```{r}
dim(train)
dim(test)
str(train[,c(1:10, 81)]) #display first 10 variables and the response variable
```

```{r}
#Getting rid of the IDs but keeping the test IDs in a vector. These are needed to compose the submission file
test_labels <- test$Id
train$Id <- NULL
test$Id <- NULL
```

```{r}
test$SalePrice <- NA
house <- rbind(train, test)
dim(house)
tail(house)
```

Without the Id's, the dataframe consists of 79 predictors and our response variable SalePrice.

#Getting summary statistics

```{r}
sum(sapply(house[,1:80], typeof) == "character")

#Count the number of columns that consists of numerical data

sum(sapply(house[,1:80], typeof) == "integer")
```

We have 43 columns as character and 37 columns are numerical.let’s take a look at some descriptive statistics

```{r}
# Obtain summary statistics
summary(train[,sapply(house[,1:80], typeof) == "integer"])
```

As we can see from the summary statistics above, there are some outliers needs to be proceessed. It would be clear to identify which dependant variables that need processing after the visualization step.

First of all, I would like to see which variables contain missing values.

```{r}
# The percentage of data missing in train

cat(sprintf("Percentage of missing values in the overall train dataset: %s%s\n", round(length(which(is.na(house) == TRUE)) * 100 / (nrow(house) * ncol(house)), 2), "%"))
```

```{r}
NAcol <- which(colSums(is.na(house)) > 0)
sort(colSums(sapply(house[NAcol], is.na)), decreasing = TRUE)
cat('There are', length(NAcol), 'columns with missing values')
```

```{r}
# matrix of the p-value of the correlation
# p.mat <- cor(house_numVar, method = c("spearman"))
```

#Exploring some of the most important variables

##The response variable; **SalePrice**

As you can see, the sale prices are right skewed. This was expected as few people can afford very expensive houses. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=SalePrice)) +
        geom_histogram(col = 'white' ,fill="brown", binwidth = 15000) +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
#Normalize distribution
ggplot(train, aes(x=log(SalePrice+1))) + 
  geom_histogram(col = 'white', fill = 'brown') + 
  theme_light()
```


```{r}
summary(house$SalePrice)
```


##The most important numeric predictors

The character variables need some work before I can use them. To get a feel for the dataset, I decided to first see which numeric variables have a high correlation with the SalePrice.

###Correlations with SalePrice

Altogether, there are 10 numeric variables with a correlation of at least 0.5 with SalePrice. house those correlations are positive.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
numericVars <- which(sapply(house, is.numeric)) #index vector numeric variables
numericVarNames <- names(numericVars) #saving names vector for use later on
cat('There are', length(numericVars), 'numeric variables')

house_numVar <- house[, numericVars]
cor_numVar <- cor(house_numVar, use="pairwise.complete.obs") #correlations of house numeric variables

#sort on decreasing correlations with SalePrice
cor_sorted <- as.matrix(sort(cor_numVar[,'SalePrice'], decreasing = TRUE))
 #select only high corelations
CorHigh <- names(which(apply(cor_sorted, 1, function(x) abs(x)>0.5)))
cor_numVar <- cor_numVar[CorHigh, CorHigh]

corrplot.mixed(cor_numVar, tl.col="black", tl.pos = "lt")
```


I will visualize the relation between SalePrice and the two predictors with the highest correlation with SalePrice; Overall Quality and the 'Above Grade' Living Area.

It also becomes clear the multicollinearity is an issue. For example: the correlation between GarageCars and GarageArea is very high (0.89), and both have similar (high) correlations with SalePrice. The other 6 six variables with a correlation higher than 0.5 with SalePrice are:

-TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area
-1stFlrSF: First Floor square feet
-FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade
-TotRmsAbvGrd: Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)
-YearBuilt: Original construction date
-YearRemodAdd: Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions)


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

signif_col <- house %>%
  select(`YearBuilt`, `FullBath`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `X1stFlrSF`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`, `YearRemodAdd`, `SalePrice`)
# options(repr.plot.width = 20, repr.plot.height = 20)
ggpairs(signif_col)
```


###Overall Quality

Overall Quality has the highest correlation with SalePrice among the numeric variables (0.79). It rates the overall material and finish of the house on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (very excellent).

```{r}
ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=factor(OverallQual), y=SalePrice))+
        geom_boxplot(col='blue') + labs(x='Overall Quality') +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
```

The positive correlation is certainly there indeed, and seems to be a slightly upward curve. Regarding outliers, I do not see any extreme values. If there is a candidate to take out as an outlier later on, it seems to be the expensive house with grade 4.

###Above Grade (Ground) Living Area (square feet)

The numeric variable with the second highest correlation with SalesPrice is the Above Grade Living Area. This make a lot of sense; big houses are generally more expensive.

```{r}
ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=GrLivArea, y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma) +
        geom_text_repel(aes(label = ifelse(house$GrLivArea[!is.na(house$SalePrice)]>4500, rownames(house), '')))
        
```

Especially the two houses with really big living areas and low SalePrices seem outliers (houses 524 and 1299, see labels in graph). I will not take them out yet, as taking outliers can be dangerous. For instance, a low score on the Overall Quality could explain a low price. However, as you can see below, these two houses actually also score maximum points on Overall Quality. Therefore, I will keep houses 1299 and 524 in mind as prime candidates to take out as outliers.

```{r}
house[c(524, 1299), c('SalePrice', 'GrLivArea', 'OverallQual')]
```

Derive a correlation matrix for any three quantitative variables in the dataset.

```{r}
cor_se <- house_numVar %>% 
  dplyr::select(SalePrice, OverallQual, GrLivArea)

ggcorr((cor_se), palette = "RdBu", label = TRUE)
```

Test the hypotheses:

- H0: The correlation is zero.
- H1: The correlation is not zero.
- Significance level is 0.05.

```{r}
(ov_vs_sal <- cor.test(cor_se$OverallQual, cor_se$SalePrice, method = 'pearson'))
(gr_vs_ov <- cor.test(cor_se$GrLivArea, cor_se$OverallQual, method = 'pearson'))
(gr_vs_sal <- cor.test(cor_se$GrLivArea, cor_se$SalePrice, method = 'pearson'))
# (tot_vs_sal <- cor.test(cor_se$TotRmsAbvGrd, cor_se$SalePrice, method = 'pearson'))
```

The p-value in the three varaibles is below significance level of 0.05 - around 2.2e-16. This implies that the correlation falls within the c(0.8, 0.2) confidence interval and we failed to accept the null **hypothese** which assumes that the correlation is zero.

The 80% confidence interval

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(psychometric)
(CIr(r = ov_vs_sal$estimate, n = nrow(cor_se), level = 0.8))
(CIr(r = gr_vs_sal$estimate, n = nrow(cor_se), level = 0.8))
(CIr(r = gr_vs_ov$estimate, n = nrow(cor_se), level = 0.8))
# (CIr(r = tot_vs_sal$estimate, n = nrow(corr), level = 0.8))
```

To calculate the familywize error (type-I error) $FWE <= 1-(1-alpha)^c$ where:  
1. $alpha$ is the alpha level for an individual test - in this case it is 0.05. 
2. $c$ is the number of comparisons, which is 3.

```{r}
perc <- (1 - (1 - 0.05)^3)
cat(sprintf("The probability of a type-I error is : %s%s\n", perc, " "))
```

Yes, I would be worry about that probability, which is very high considering only three tests were performed.

## Linear Algebra and Correlation 

Invert your correlation matrix from above. (This is known as the precision matrix and contains variance inflation factors on the diagonal.) Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix, and then multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix. Conduct LU decomposition on the matrix.

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
te <- rcorr(as.matrix(cor_se))
te$r
```

The determinant of the correlation matrix not zero, the matrix has an inverse

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(matlib)
det(te$r) # get determinant
(precision_mat <- round(solve(te$r), 2)) # this is the precision matrix get the inverse matrix
```


```{r}
(round(te$r%*%precision_mat, 2))
(round(precision_mat%*%te$r, 2))
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(matrixcalc)
# LU decomposition 

(cor_lu <- lu.decomposition(te$r))
# multiply L and U 
# 
(res_2 <- round(cor_lu$L %*% cor_lu$U, 2) )
```

Confirm the results 

```{r}
round(cor_lu$L %*% cor_lu$U ,2) == round(te$r,2)
```

**Calculus-Based Probability & Statistics.**  Many times, it makes sense to fit a closed form distribution to data.  Select a variable in the Kaggle.com training dataset that is skewed to the right, shift it so that the minimum value is absolutely above zero if necessary.  Then load the MASS package and run fitdistr to fit an exponential probability density function.  (See  https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/fitdistr.html ).  Find the optimal value of λ for this distribution, and then take 1000 samples from this exponential distribution using this value (e.g., rexp(1000, λ)).  Plot a histogram and compare it with a histogram of your original variable. Using the exponential pdf, find the 5th and 95th percentiles using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).   Also generate a 95% confidence interval from the empirical data, assuming normality.  Finally, provide the empirical 5th percentile and 95th percentile of the data.  Discuss.


```{r}
fit_data <- house$MasVnrArea
fit_data <- fit_data[complete.cases(fit_data)]
hist(fit_data)
summary(fit_data)
```

```{r}
length(fit_data[fit_data == 0])
```
There are 1738 that have no masonry veneers (area is zero).

Because the data measures area, adding a value of .01 should be negligible and would get rid of the zero values. A property with a masonry veneer area of .01 square feet would mean this property does not really have any masonry veneer.


```{r}
fit_data <- fit_data + .01
hist(fit_data)
summary(fit_data)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MASS)
fit <- fitdistr(fit_data, densfun = "exponential")
# the optimal value
fit$estimate
```

```{r}
exp <- rexp(length(fit_data), rate = fit$estimate) 
hist(exp)
```


```{r}
qexp(.05, rate=fit$estimate)
qexp(.95, rate=fit$estimate)
```

```{r}
norm.interval = function(data, variance = var(data), conf.level = 0.95) 
{
      z = qnorm((1 - conf.level)/2, lower.tail = FALSE)
      xbar = mean(data)
      sdx = sqrt(variance/length(data))
      c(xbar - z * sdx, xbar + z * sdx)
}

norm.interval(fit_data, variance=var(fit_data), conf.level = 0.95)
```


```{r}
quantile(x=fit_data, probs=c(.05, .95))
```


#Missing data, label encoding, and factorizing variables

##Completeness of the data

First of all, I would like to see which variables contain missing values.

```{r}
NAcol <- which(colSums(is.na(house)) > 0)
sort(colSums(sapply(house[NAcol], is.na)), decreasing = TRUE)
cat('There are', length(NAcol), 'columns with missing values')
```

Of course, the 1459 NAs in SalePrice match the size of the test set perfectly. This means that I have to fix NAs in 34 predictor variables.

##Imputing missing data {.tabset}

In this section, I am going to fix the 34 predictors that contains missing values. I will go through them working my way down from most NAs until I have fixed them all. If I stumble upon a variable that actually forms a group with other variables, I will also deal with them as a group. For instance, there are multiple variables that relate to Pool, Garage, and Basement.

As I want to keep the document as readable as possible, I decided to use the "Tabs" option that knitr provides. You can find a short analysis for each (group of) variables under each Tab. You don't have to go through all sections, and can also just have a look at a few tabs. If you do so, I think that especially the Garage and Basement sections are worthwhile, as I have been carefull in determing which houses really do not have a basement or garage.

Besides making sure that the NAs are taken care off, I have also converted character variables into ordinal integers if there is clear ordinality, or into factors if levels are categories without ordinality. I will convert these factors into numeric later on by using one-hot encoding (using the model.matrix function).

###Pool variables

**Pool Quality and the PoolArea variable**

The PoolQC is the variable with most NAs. The description is as follows:

PoolQC: Pool quality
		
       Ex	Excellent
       Gd	Good
       TA	Average/Typical
       Fa	Fair
       NA	No Pool
       
So, it is obvious that I need to just assign 'No Pool' to the NAs. Also, the high number of NAs makes sense as normally only a small proportion of houses have a pool.

```{r}
house$PoolQC[is.na(house$PoolQC)] <- 'None'
```

It is also clear that I can label encode this variable as the values are ordinal. As there a multiple variables that use the same quality levels, I am going to create a vector that I can reuse later on.

```{r}
Qualities <- c('None' = 0, 'Po' = 1, 'Fa' = 2, 'TA' = 3, 'Gd' = 4, 'Ex' = 5)
```

Now, I can use the function 'revalue' to do the work for me.

```{r, message=FALSE}

house$PoolQC<-as.integer(revalue(house$PoolQC, Qualities))
table(house$PoolQC)
```

However, there is a second variable that relates to Pools. This is the PoolArea variable (in square feet). As you can see below, there are 3 houses without PoolQC. First, I checked if there was a clear relation between the PoolArea and the PoolQC. As I did not see a clear relation (bigger of smaller pools with better PoolQC), I am going to impute PoolQC values based on the Overall Quality of the houses (which is not very high for those 3 houses).

```{r}
house[house$PoolArea>0 & house$PoolQC==0, c('PoolArea', 'PoolQC', 'OverallQual')]

house$PoolQC[2421] <- 2
house$PoolQC[2504] <- 3
house$PoolQC[2600] <- 2
```

###Miscellaneous Feature

**Miscellaneous feature not covered in other categories**

Within Miscellaneous Feature, there are 2814 NAs. As the values are not ordinal, I will convert MiscFeature into a factor. Values:	

       Elev	Elevator
       Gar2	2nd Garage (if not described in garage section)
       Othr	Other
       Shed	Shed (over 100 SF)
       TenC	Tennis Court
       NA	None

```{r}
house$MiscFeature[is.na(house$MiscFeature)] <- 'None'
house$MiscFeature <- as.factor(house$MiscFeature)

ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=MiscFeature, y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..))

table(house$MiscFeature)
```

When looking at the frequencies, the variable seems irrelevant to me. Having a shed probably means 'no Garage', which would explain the lower sales price for Shed. Also, while it makes a lot of sense that a house with a Tennis court is expensive, there is only one house with a tennis court in the training set.

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Alley

**Type of alley access to property**

Within Alley, there are 2721 NAs. As the values are not ordinal, I will convert Alley into a factor. Values:

       Grvl	Gravel
       Pave	Paved
       NA 	No alley access

```{r}
house$Alley[is.na(house$Alley)] <- 'None'
house$Alley <- as.factor(house$Alley)

ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=Alley, y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue')+
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 200000, by=50000), labels = comma)

table(house$Alley)
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Fence

**Fence quality**

Within Fence, there are 2348 NAs. The values seem to be ordinal. Values:

       GdPrv	Good Privacy
       MnPrv	Minimum Privacy
       GdWo	Good Wood
       MnWw	Minimum Wood/Wire
       NA	No Fence

```{r}
house$Fence[is.na(house$Fence)] <- 'None'
table(house$Fence)
house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),] %>% group_by(Fence) %>% summarise(median = median(SalePrice), counts=n())
```

My conclusion is that the values do not seem ordinal (no fence is best). Therefore, I will convert Fence into a factor.

```{r}
house$Fence <- as.factor(house$Fence)
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Fireplace variables

**Fireplace quality, and Number of fireplaces**

Within Fireplace Quality, there are 1420 NAs. Number of fireplaces is complete.

**Fireplace quality**

The number of NAs in FireplaceQu matches the number of houses with 0 fireplaces. This means that I can safely replace the NAs in FireplaceQu with 'no fireplace'. The values are ordinal, and I can use the Qualities vector that I have already created for the Pool Quality. Values:

       Ex	Excellent - Exceptional Masonry Fireplace
       Gd	Good - Masonry Fireplace in main level
       TA	Average - Prefabricated Fireplace in main living area or Masonry Fireplace in basement
       Fa	Fair - Prefabricated Fireplace in basement
       Po	Poor - Ben Franklin Stove
       NA	No Fireplace

```{r}
house$FireplaceQu[is.na(house$FireplaceQu)] <- 'None'
house$FireplaceQu<-as.integer(revalue(house$FireplaceQu, Qualities))
table(house$FireplaceQu)
```

**Number of fireplaces**

Fireplaces is an integer variable, and there are no missing values.
```{r}
table(house$Fireplaces)
sum(table(house$Fireplaces))
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Lot variables

3 variables. One with 1 NA, and 2 complete variables.

**LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property**

486 NAs. The most reasonable imputation seems to take the median per neigborhood.

```{r}
ggplot(house[!is.na(house$LotFrontage),], aes(x=as.factor(Neighborhood), y=LotFrontage)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(house)){
        if(is.na(house$LotFrontage[i])){
               house$LotFrontage[i] <- as.integer(median(house$LotFrontage[house$Neighborhood==house$Neighborhood[i]], na.rm=TRUE)) 
        }
}
```

**LotShape: General shape of property**

No NAs. Values seem ordinal (Regular=best)

       Reg	Regular	
       IR1	Slightly irregular
       IR2	Moderately Irregular
       IR3	Irregular

```{r}
house$LotShape<-as.integer(revalue(house$LotShape, c('IR3'=0, 'IR2'=1, 'IR1'=2, 'Reg'=3)))
table(house$LotShape)
sum(table(house$LotShape))
```

**LotConfig: Lot configuration**

No NAs. The values seemed possibly ordinal to me, but the visualization does not show this. Therefore, I will convert the variable into a factor.

       Inside	Inside lot
       Corner	Corner lot
       CulDSac	Cul-de-sac
       FR2	Frontage on 2 sides of property
       FR3	Frontage on 3 sides of property
       
```{r}
ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=as.factor(LotConfig), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue')+
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..))
```

```{r}
house$LotConfig <- as.factor(house$LotConfig)
table(house$LotConfig)
sum(table(house$LotConfig))
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Garage variables

**Altogether, there are 7 variables related to garages**

Two of those have one NA (GarageCars and GarageArea), one has 157 NAs (GarageType), 4 variables have 159 NAs. 

First of all, I am going to replace all 159 missing **GarageYrBlt: Year garage was built** values with the values in YearBuilt (this is similar to YearRemodAdd, which also defaults to YearBuilt if no remodeling or additions).

```{r}
house$GarageYrBlt[is.na(house$GarageYrBlt)] <- house$YearBuilt[is.na(house$GarageYrBlt)]
```

As NAs mean 'No Garage' for character variables, I now want to find out where the differences between the 157 NA GarageType and the other 3 character variables with 159 NAs come from.

```{r}
#check if house 157 NAs are the same observations among the variables with 157/159 NAs
length(which(is.na(house$GarageType) & is.na(house$GarageFinish) & is.na(house$GarageCond) & is.na(house$GarageQual)))

#Find the 2 additional NAs
kable(house[!is.na(house$GarageType) & is.na(house$GarageFinish), c('GarageCars', 'GarageArea', 'GarageType', 'GarageCond', 'GarageQual', 'GarageFinish')])
```

The 157 NAs within GarageType all turn out to be NA in GarageCondition, GarageQuality, and GarageFinish as well. The differences are found in houses 2127 and 2577. As you can see, house 2127 actually does seem to have a Garage and house 2577 does not. Therefore, there should be 158 houses without a Garage. To fix house 2127, I will imputate the most common values (modes) for GarageCond, GarageQual, and GarageFinish.

```{r}
#Imputing modes.
house$GarageCond[2127] <- names(sort(-table(house$GarageCond)))[1]
house$GarageQual[2127] <- names(sort(-table(house$GarageQual)))[1]
house$GarageFinish[2127] <- names(sort(-table(house$GarageFinish)))[1]

#display "fixed" house
kable(house[2127, c('GarageYrBlt', 'GarageCars', 'GarageArea', 'GarageType', 'GarageCond', 'GarageQual', 'GarageFinish')])
```

**GarageCars and GarageArea: Size of garage in car capacity and Size of garage in square** 

Both have 1 NA. As you can see above, it is house 2577 for both variables. The problem probably occured as the GarageType for this house is "detached", while all other Garage-variables seem to indicate that this house has no Garage.

```{r}
#fixing 3 values for house 2577
house$GarageCars[2577] <- 0
house$GarageArea[2577] <- 0
house$GarageType[2577] <- NA

#check if NAs of the character variables are now all 158
length(which(is.na(house$GarageType) & is.na(house$GarageFinish) & is.na(house$GarageCond) & is.na(house$GarageQual)))
```

Now, the 4 character variables related to garage all have the same set of 158 NAs, which correspond to 'No Garage'. I will fix all of them in the remainder of this section

**GarageType: Garage location**

The values do not seem ordinal, so I will convert into a factor.

       2Types	More than one type of garage
       Attchd	Attached to home
       Basment	Basement Garage
       BuiltIn	Built-In (Garage part of house - typically has room above garage)
       CarPort	Car Port
       Detchd	Detached from home
       NA	No Garage

```{r}
house$GarageType[is.na(house$GarageType)] <- 'No Garage'
house$GarageType <- as.factor(house$GarageType)
table(house$GarageType)
```

**GarageFinish: Interior finish of the garage**

The values are ordinal.

       Fin	Finished
       RFn	Rough Finished	
       Unf	Unfinished
       NA	No Garage       

```{r}
house$GarageFinish[is.na(house$GarageFinish)] <- 'None'
Finish <- c('None'=0, 'Unf'=1, 'RFn'=2, 'Fin'=3)

house$GarageFinish<-as.integer(revalue(house$GarageFinish, Finish))
table(house$GarageFinish)
```

**GarageQual: Garage quality**

Another variable than can be made ordinal with the Qualities vector.

       Ex	Excellent
       Gd	Good
       TA	Typical/Average
       Fa	Fair
       Po	Poor
       NA	No Garage
       
```{r}
house$GarageQual[is.na(house$GarageQual)] <- 'None'
house$GarageQual<-as.integer(revalue(house$GarageQual, Qualities))
table(house$GarageQual)
```

**GarageCond: Garage condition**

Another variable than can be made ordinal with the Qualities vector.

       Ex	Excellent
       Gd	Good
       TA	Typical/Average
       Fa	Fair
       Po	Poor
       NA	No Garage

```{r}
house$GarageCond[is.na(house$GarageCond)] <- 'None'
house$GarageCond<-as.integer(revalue(house$GarageCond, Qualities))
table(house$GarageCond)
```

###Basement Variables

**Altogether, there are 11 variables that relate to the Basement of a house**

Five of those have 79-82 NAs, six have one or two NAs.

```{r}
#check if house 79 NAs are the same observations among the variables with 80+ NAs
length(which(is.na(house$BsmtQual) & is.na(house$BsmtCond) & is.na(house$BsmtExposure) & is.na(house$BsmtFinType1) & is.na(house$BsmtFinType2)))

#Find the additional NAs; BsmtFinType1 is the one with 79 NAs
house[!is.na(house$BsmtFinType1) & (is.na(house$BsmtCond)|is.na(house$BsmtQual)|is.na(house$BsmtExposure)|is.na(house$BsmtFinType2)), c('BsmtQual', 'BsmtCond', 'BsmtExposure', 'BsmtFinType1', 'BsmtFinType2')]
```

So altogether, it seems as if there are 79 houses without a basement, because the basement variables of the other houses with missing values are all 80% complete (missing 1 out of 5 values). I am going to impute the modes to fix those 9 houses.

```{r}
#Imputing modes.
house$BsmtFinType2[333] <- names(sort(-table(house$BsmtFinType2)))[1]
house$BsmtExposure[c(949, 1488, 2349)] <- names(sort(-table(house$BsmtExposure)))[1]
house$BsmtCond[c(2041, 2186, 2525)] <- names(sort(-table(house$BsmtCond)))[1]
house$BsmtQual[c(2218, 2219)] <- names(sort(-table(house$BsmtQual)))[1]
```

Now that the 5 variables considered agree upon 79 houses with 'no basement', I am going to factorize/hot encode them below.

**BsmtQual: Evaluates the height of the basement**

A variable than can be made ordinal with the Qualities vector.

       Ex	Excellent (100+ inches)	
       Gd	Good (90-99 inches)
       TA	Typical (80-89 inches)
       Fa	Fair (70-79 inches)
       Po	Poor (<70 inches
       NA	No Basement

```{r, message=FALSE}
house$BsmtQual[is.na(house$BsmtQual)] <- 'None'
house$BsmtQual<-as.integer(revalue(house$BsmtQual, Qualities))
table(house$BsmtQual)
```
		
**BsmtCond: Evaluates the general condition of the basement**

A variable than can be made ordinal with the Qualities vector.

       Ex	Excellent
       Gd	Good
       TA	Typical - slight dampness allowed
       Fa	Fair - dampness or some cracking or settling
       Po	Poor - Severe cracking, settling, or wetness
       NA	No Basement

```{r, message=FALSE}
house$BsmtCond[is.na(house$BsmtCond)] <- 'None'
house$BsmtCond<-as.integer(revalue(house$BsmtCond, Qualities))
table(house$BsmtCond)
```
	
**BsmtExposure: Refers to walkout or garden level walls**

A variable than can be made ordinal.

       Gd	Good Exposure
       Av	Average Exposure (split levels or foyers typically score average or above)	
       Mn	Mimimum Exposure
       No	No Exposure
       NA	No Basement

```{r}
house$BsmtExposure[is.na(house$BsmtExposure)] <- 'None'
Exposure <- c('None'=0, 'No'=1, 'Mn'=2, 'Av'=3, 'Gd'=4)

house$BsmtExposure<-as.integer(revalue(house$BsmtExposure, Exposure))
table(house$BsmtExposure)
```
       
**BsmtFinType1: Rating of basement finished area**

A variable than can be made ordinal.

       GLQ	Good Living Quarters
       ALQ	Average Living Quarters
       BLQ	Below Average Living Quarters	
       Rec	Average Rec Room
       LwQ	Low Quality
       Unf	Unfinshed
       NA	No Basement
		
```{r}
house$BsmtFinType1[is.na(house$BsmtFinType1)] <- 'None'
FinType <- c('None'=0, 'Unf'=1, 'LwQ'=2, 'Rec'=3, 'BLQ'=4, 'ALQ'=5, 'GLQ'=6)

house$BsmtFinType1<-as.integer(revalue(house$BsmtFinType1, FinType))
table(house$BsmtFinType1)
```

**BsmtFinType2: Rating of basement finished area (if multiple types)**

A variable than can be made ordinal with the FinType vector.

       GLQ	Good Living Quarters
       ALQ	Average Living Quarters
       BLQ	Below Average Living Quarters	
       Rec	Average Rec Room
       LwQ	Low Quality
       Unf	Unfinshed
       NA	No Basement

```{r}
house$BsmtFinType2[is.na(house$BsmtFinType2)] <- 'None'
FinType <- c('None'=0, 'Unf'=1, 'LwQ'=2, 'Rec'=3, 'BLQ'=4, 'ALQ'=5, 'GLQ'=6)

house$BsmtFinType2<-as.integer(revalue(house$BsmtFinType2, FinType))
table(house$BsmtFinType2)
```

**Remaining Basement variabes with just a few NAs**

I now still have to deal with those 6 variables that have 1 or 2 NAs.

```{r}
#display remaining NAs. Using BsmtQual as a reference for the 79 houses without basement agreed upon earlier
house[(is.na(house$BsmtFullBath)|is.na(house$BsmtHalfBath)|is.na(house$BsmtFinSF1)|is.na(house$BsmtFinSF2)|is.na(house$BsmtUnfSF)|is.na(house$TotalBsmtSF)), c('BsmtQual', 'BsmtFullBath', 'BsmtHalfBath', 'BsmtFinSF1', 'BsmtFinSF2', 'BsmtUnfSF', 'TotalBsmtSF')]
```

It should be obvious that those remaining NAs all refer to 'not present'. Below, I am fixing those remaining variables.

**BsmtFullBath: Basement full bathrooms**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$BsmtFullBath[is.na(house$BsmtFullBath)] <-0
table(house$BsmtFullBath)
```

**BsmtHalfBath: Basement half bathrooms**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$BsmtHalfBath[is.na(house$BsmtHalfBath)] <-0
table(house$BsmtHalfBath)
```

**BsmtFinSF1: Type 1 finished square feet**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$BsmtFinSF1[is.na(house$BsmtFinSF1)] <-0
```

**BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 finished square feet**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$BsmtFinSF2[is.na(house$BsmtFinSF2)] <-0
```

**BsmtUnfSF: Unfinished square feet of basement area**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$BsmtUnfSF[is.na(house$BsmtUnfSF)] <-0
```

**TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$TotalBsmtSF[is.na(house$TotalBsmtSF)] <-0
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Masonry variables

**Masonry veneer type, and masonry veneer area**

Masonry veneer type has 24 NAs. Masonry veneer area has 23 NAs. If a house has a veneer area, it should also have a masonry veneer type. Let's fix this one first.

```{r}
#check if the 23 houses with veneer area NA are also NA in the veneer type
length(which(is.na(house$MasVnrType) & is.na(house$MasVnrArea)))

#find the one that should have a MasVnrType
house[is.na(house$MasVnrType) & !is.na(house$MasVnrArea), c('MasVnrType', 'MasVnrArea')]
```

```{r}
#fix this veneer type by imputing the mode
house$MasVnrType[2611] <- names(sort(-table(house$MasVnrType)))[2] #taking the 2nd value as the 1st is 'none'
house[2611, c('MasVnrType', 'MasVnrArea')]
```

This leaves me with 23 houses that really have no masonry.

**Masonry veneer type**

Will check the ordinality below.

       BrkCmn	Brick Common
       BrkFace	Brick Face
       CBlock	Cinder Block
       None	None
       Stone	Stone

```{r}
house$MasVnrType[is.na(house$MasVnrType)] <- 'None'

house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),] %>% group_by(MasVnrType) %>% summarise(median = median(SalePrice), counts=n()) %>% arrange(median)
```

There seems to be a significant difference between "common brick/none" and the other types. I assume that simple stones and for instance wooden houses are just cheaper. I will make the ordinality accordingly.

```{r}
Masonry <- c('None'=0, 'BrkCmn'=0, 'BrkFace'=1, 'Stone'=2)
house$MasVnrType<-as.integer(revalue(house$MasVnrType, Masonry))
table(house$MasVnrType)
```

**MasVnrArea: Masonry veneer area in square feet**

An integer variable.
```{r}
house$MasVnrArea[is.na(house$MasVnrArea)] <-0
```

###MS Zoning

**MSZoning: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale**

4 NAs. Values are categorical.

       A	Agriculture
       C	Commercial
       FV	Floating Village Residential
       I	Industrial
       RH	Residential High Density
       RL	Residential Low Density
       RP	Residential Low Density Park 
       RM	Residential Medium Density

```{r}
#imputing the mode
house$MSZoning[is.na(house$MSZoning)] <- names(sort(-table(house$MSZoning)))[1]
house$MSZoning <- as.factor(house$MSZoning)
table(house$MSZoning)
sum(table(house$MSZoning))
```

###Kitchen variables

**Kitchen quality and numer of Kitchens above grade**

Kitchen quality has 1 NA. Number of Kitchens is complete.

**Kitchen quality**

1NA. Can be made ordinal with the qualities vector.

       Ex	Excellent
       Gd	Good
       TA	Typical/Average
       Fa	Fair
       Po	Poor
 
```{r, message=FALSE}
house$KitchenQual[is.na(house$KitchenQual)] <- 'TA' #replace with most common value
house$KitchenQual<-as.integer(revalue(house$KitchenQual, Qualities))
table(house$KitchenQual)
sum(table(house$KitchenQual))
```

**Number of Kitchens above grade**

An integer variable with no NAs.
```{r}
table(house$KitchenAbvGr)
sum(table(house$KitchenAbvGr))
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Utilities

**Utilities: Type of utilities available**

2 NAs. Ordinal as additional utilities is better.

       AllPub	All public Utilities (E,G,W,& S)	
       NoSewr	Electricity, Gas, and Water (Septic Tank)
       NoSeWa	Electricity and Gas Only
       ELO	Electricity only

However, the table below shows that only one house does not have all public utilities. This house is in the train set. Therefore, imputing 'AllPub' for the NAs means that all houses in the test set will have 'AllPub'. This makes the variable useless for prediction. Consequently, I will get rid of it.

```{r, message=FALSE}
table(house$Utilities)
kable(house[is.na(house$Utilities) | house$Utilities=='NoSeWa', 1:9])
house$Utilities <- NULL
```

**Please return to the 5.2 Tabs menu to select other (groups of) variables**

###Home functionality

**Functional: Home functionality**

1NA. Can be made ordinal (salvage only is worst, typical is best).

       Typ	Typical Functionality
       Min1	Minor Deductions 1
       Min2	Minor Deductions 2
       Mod	Moderate Deductions
       Maj1	Major Deductions 1
       Maj2	Major Deductions 2
       Sev	Severely Damaged
       Sal	Salvage only


```{r, message=FALSE}
#impute mode for the 1 NA
house$Functional[is.na(house$Functional)] <- names(sort(-table(house$Functional)))[1]

house$Functional <- as.integer(revalue(house$Functional, c('Sal'=0, 'Sev'=1, 'Maj2'=2, 'Maj1'=3, 'Mod'=4, 'Min2'=5, 'Min1'=6, 'Typ'=7)))
table(house$Functional)
sum(table(house$Functional))

##Label encoding/factorizing the remaining character variables {.tabset}

At this point, I have made sure that all variables with NAs are taken care of. However, I still need to also take care of the remaining character variables that without missing values. Similar to the previous section, I have created Tabs for groups of variables.

###Dwelling

2 variables that specify the type and style of dwelling.

**BldgType: Type of dwelling**
		
       1Fam	Single-family Detached	
       2FmCon	Two-family Conversion; originally built as one-family dwelling
       Duplx	Duplex
       TwnhsE	Townhouse End Unit
       TwnhsI	Townhouse Inside Unit

This seems ordinal to me (single family detached=best). Let's check it with visualization.

```{r}
ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=as.factor(BldgType), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue')+
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..))
```

However, the visualization does not show ordinality.

```{r}
#No ordinality, so converting into factors
house$BldgType <- as.factor(house$BldgType)
table(house$BldgType)
sum(table(house$BldgType))
```
	
**HouseStyle: Style of dwelling**
	
       1Story	One story
       1.5Fin	One and one-half story: 2nd level finished
       1.5Unf	One and one-half story: 2nd level unfinished
       2Story	Two story
       2.5Fin	Two and one-half story: 2nd level finished
       2.5Unf	Two and one-half story: 2nd level unfinished
       SFoyer	Split Foyer
       SLvl	Split Level

```{r}
#No ordinality, so converting into factors
house$HouseStyle <- as.factor(house$HouseStyle)
table(house$HouseStyle)
sum(table(house$HouseStyle))
```

       Somerst	Somerset
       StoneBr	Stone Brook
       Timber	Timberland
       Veenker	Veenker

```{r}
#No ordinality, so converting into factors
house$Neighborhood <- as.factor(house$Neighborhood)
table(house$Neighborhood)
sum(table(house$Neighborhood))
```

**Condition1: Proximity to various conditions**

       RRAe	Adjacent to East-West Railroad

```{r}
#No ordinality, so converting into factors
house$Condition2 <- as.factor(house$Condition2)
table(house$Condition2)
sum(table(house$Condition2))
```

##Changing some numeric variables into factors

At this point, all variables are complete (No NAs), and all character variables are converted into either numeric labels of into factors. However, there are 3 variables that are recorded numeric but should actually be categorical.

###Year and Month Sold

While oridinality within YearBuilt (or remodeled) makes sense (old houses are worth less), we are talking about only 5 years of sales. These years also include an economic crisis. For instance: Sale Prices in 2009 (after the collapse) are very likely to be much lower than in 2007. I wil convert YrSold into a factor before modeling, but as I need the numeric version of YrSold to create an Age variable, I am not doing that yet.

Month Sold is also an Integer variable. However, December is not "better" than January. Therefore, I will convert MoSold values back into factors.

```{r}
str(house$YrSold)
str(house$MoSold)
house$MoSold <- as.factor(house$MoSold)
```

Although possible a bit less steep than expected, the effects of the Banking crises that took place at the end of 2007 can be seen indeed. After the highest median prices in 2007, the prices gradually decreased. However, seasonality seems to play a bigger role, as you can see below.

```{r}
ys <- ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=as.factor(YrSold), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue')+
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=25000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..)) +
        coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 200000)) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed", color = "red") #dashed line is median SalePrice

ms <- ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=MoSold, y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue')+
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=25000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..)) +
        coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 200000)) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed", color = "red") #dashed line is median SalePrice

grid.arrange(ys, ms, widths=c(1,2))
```

###MSSubClass

MSSubClass: Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.	

        20	1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES
        30	1-STORY 1945 & OLDER
        40	1-STORY W/FINISHED ATTIC ALL AGES
        45	1-1/2 STORY - UNFINISHED ALL AGES
        50	1-1/2 STORY FINISHED ALL AGES
        60	2-STORY 1946 & NEWER
        70	2-STORY 1945 & OLDER
        75	2-1/2 STORY ALL AGES
        80	SPLIT OR MULTI-LEVEL
        85	SPLIT FOYER
        90	DUPLEX - ALL STYLES AND AGES
       120	1-STORY PUD (Planned Unit Development) - 1946 & NEWER
       150	1-1/2 STORY PUD - ALL AGES
       160	2-STORY PUD - 1946 & NEWER
       180	PUD - MULTILEVEL - INCL SPLIT LEV/FOYER
       190	2 FAMILY CONVERSION - ALL STYLES AND AGES

These classes are coded as numbers, but really are categories.

```{r}
str(house$MSSubClass)

house$MSSubClass <- as.factor(house$MSSubClass)

#revalue for better readability
house$MSSubClass<-revalue(house$MSSubClass, c('20'='1 story 1946+', '30'='1 story 1945-', '40'='1 story unf attic', '45'='1,5 story unf', '50'='1,5 story fin', '60'='2 story 1946+', '70'='2 story 1945-', '75'='2,5 story all ages', '80'='split/multi level', '85'='split foyer', '90'='duplex all style/age', '120'='1 story PUD 1946+', '150'='1,5 story PUD all', '160'='2 story PUD 1946+', '180'='PUD multilevel', '190'='2 family conversion'))

str(house$MSSubClass)
```

#Visualization of important variables

I have now finally reached the point where all character variables have been converted into categorical factors or have been label encoded into numbers. In addition, 3 numeric variables have been converted into factors, and I deleted one variable (Utilities). As you can see below, the number of numerical variables is now 56 (including the response variable), and the remaining 23 variables are categorical.

```{r}
numericVars <- which(sapply(house, is.numeric)) #index vector numeric variables
factorVars <- which(sapply(house, is.factor)) #index vector factor variables
cat('There are', length(numericVars), 'numeric variables, and', length(factorVars), 'categoric variables')
```

##Correlations again

Below I am checking the correlations again. As you can see, the number of variables with a correlation of at least 0.5 with the SalePrice has increased from 10 (see section 4.2.1) to 16. 

```{r, out.width="100%"}
all_numVar <- house[, numericVars]
cor_numVar <- cor(all_numVar, use="pairwise.complete.obs") #correlations of all numeric variables

#sort on decreasing correlations with SalePrice
cor_sorted <- as.matrix(sort(cor_numVar[,'SalePrice'], decreasing = TRUE))
 #select only high corelations
CorHigh <- names(which(apply(cor_sorted, 1, function(x) abs(x)>0.5)))
cor_numVar <- cor_numVar[CorHigh, CorHigh]

corrplot.mixed(cor_numVar, tl.col="black", tl.pos = "lt", tl.cex = 0.7,cl.cex = .7, number.cex=.7)
```

##Finding variable importance with a quick Random Forest

Although the correlations are giving a good overview of the most important numeric variables and multicolinerity among those variables, I wanted to get an overview of the most important variables including the categorical variables before moving on to visualization.

I tried to get the relative importance of variables with a quick linear regression model with the calc.relimp function of package , and also tried the boruta function of package boruta which separates the variables into groups that are important or not. However, these method took a long time. As I only want to get an indication of the variable importance, I eventually decided to keep it simple and just use a quick and dirty Random Forest model with only 100 trees. This also does the job for me, and does not take very long as I can specify a (relatively) small number of trees.

```{r}
set.seed(2018)
quick_RF <- randomForest(x=house[1:1460,-79], y=house$SalePrice[1:1460], ntree=100,importance=TRUE)
imp_RF <- importance(quick_RF)
imp_DF <- data.frame(Variables = row.names(imp_RF), MSE = imp_RF[,1])
imp_DF <- imp_DF[order(imp_DF$MSE, decreasing = TRUE),]

ggplot(imp_DF[1:20,], aes(x=reorder(Variables, MSE), y=MSE, fill=MSE)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + labs(x = 'Variables', y= '% increase MSE if variable is randomly permuted') + coord_flip() + theme(legend.position="none")
```

Only 3 of those most important variables are categorical according to RF; Neighborhood, MSSubClass, and GarageType. 

### Above Ground Living Area, and other surface related variables (in square feet)

As I have already visualized the relation between the Above Ground Living Area and SalePrice in my initial explorations, I will now just display the distribution itself. As there are more 'square feet' surface measurements in the Top 20, I am taking the opportunity to bundle them in this section. Note: GarageArea is taken care of in the Garage variables section.

I am also adding 'Total Rooms Above Ground' (TotRmsAbvGrd) as this variable is highly correlated with the Above Ground Living Area(0.81).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
s1 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=GrLivArea)) +
        geom_density() + labs(x='Square feet living area')
s2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(TotRmsAbvGrd))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count') + labs(x='Rooms above Ground')
s3 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=X1stFlrSF)) +
        geom_density() + labs(x='Square feet first floor')
s4 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=X2ndFlrSF)) +
        geom_density() + labs(x='Square feet second floor')
s5 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=TotalBsmtSF)) +
        geom_density() + labs(x='Square feet basement')
s6 <- ggplot(data= house[house$LotArea<100000,], aes(x=LotArea)) +
        geom_density() + labs(x='Square feet lot')
s7 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=LotFrontage)) +
        geom_density() + labs(x='Linear feet lot frontage')
s8 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=LowQualFinSF)) +
        geom_histogram() + labs(x='Low quality square feet 1st & 2nd')

layout <- matrix(c(1,2,5,3,4,8,6,7),4,2,byrow=TRUE)
multiplot(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, s8, layout=layout)
```

I will investigate several of these variables for outliers later on. For the lot visualization, I have already taken out the lots above 100,000 square feet (4 houses).

GrLivArea seemed to be just the total of square feet 1st and 2nd floor. However, in a later version, I discovered that there is also a variable called: LowQualFinSF: Low quality finished square feet (all floors). As you can see above (Low quality square feet 1st and 2nd) almost all houses have none of this (only 40 houses do have some). It turns out that these square feet are actually included in the GrLivArea. The correlation between those 3 variables and GrLivArea is exactely 1.

```{r}
cor(house$GrLivArea, (house$X1stFlrSF + house$X2ndFlrSF + house$LowQualFinSF))
head(house[house$LowQualFinSF>0, c('GrLivArea', 'X1stFlrSF', 'X2ndFlrSF', 'LowQualFinSF')])
```

###The most important categorical variable; Neighborhood

Th first graph shows the median SalePrice by Neighorhood. The frequency (number of houses) of each Neighborhood in the train set is shown in the labels.

The second graph below shows the frequencies across all data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
n1 <- ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=Neighborhood, y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=3) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed", color = "red") #dashed line is median SalePrice
n2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=Neighborhood)) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=3)+
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
grid.arrange(n1, n2)
```

###Overall Quality, and other Quality variables

I have already visualized the relation between Overall Quality and SalePrice in my initial explorations, but I want to visualize the frequency distribution as well. As there are more quality measurements, I am taking the opportunity to bundle them in this section.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
q1 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(OverallQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
q2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(ExterQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
q3 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(BsmtQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
q4 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(KitchenQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
q5 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(GarageQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
q6 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(FireplaceQu))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
q7 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(PoolQC))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')

layout <- matrix(c(1,2,8,3,4,8,5,6,7),3,3,byrow=TRUE)
multiplot(q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q7, layout=layout)

```

Overall Quality is very important, and also more granular than the other variables. External Quality is also improtant, but has a high correlation with Overall Quality (0.73). Kitchen Quality also seems one to keep, as all houses have a kitchen and there is a variance with some substance. Garage Quality does not seem to distinguish much, as the majority of garages have Q3. Fireplace Quality is in the list of high correlations, and in the important variables list. The PoolQC is just very sparse (the 13 pools cannot even be seen on this scale). I will look at creating a 'has pool' variable later on.

###The second most important categorical variable; MSSubClass

The first visualization shows the median SalePrice by MSSubClass. The frequency (number of houses) of each MSSubClass in the train set is shown in the labels.

The histrogram shows the frequencies across all data. Most houses are relatively new, and have one or two stories.

```{r, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ms1 <- ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=MSSubClass, y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=3) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed", color = "red") #dashed line is median SalePrice
ms2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=MSSubClass)) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=3) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
grid.arrange(ms1, ms2)
```

###Garage variables

Several Garage variables have a high correlation with SalePrice, and are also in the top-20 list of the quick random forest. However, there is multicolinearity among them and I think that 7 garage variables is too many anyway. I feel that something like 3 variables should be sufficient (possibly GarageCars, GarageType, and a Quality measurement), but before I do any selection I am visualizing house of them in this section.

```{r}
#correct error
house$GarageYrBlt[2593] <- 2007 #this must have been a typo. GarageYrBlt=2207, YearBuilt=2006, YearRemodAdd=2007.
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
g1 <- ggplot(data=house[house$GarageCars !=0,], aes(x=GarageYrBlt)) +
        geom_histogram()
g2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(GarageCars))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
g3 <- ggplot(data= house, aes(x=GarageArea)) +
        geom_density()
g4 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(GarageCond))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
g5 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=GarageType)) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
g6 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(GarageQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
g7 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(GarageFinish))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')

layout <- matrix(c(1,5,5,2,3,8,6,4,7),3,3,byrow=TRUE)
multiplot(g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7, layout=layout)

```

As already mentioned in section 4.2, GarageCars and GarageArea are highly correlated. Here, GarageQual and GarageCond also seem highly correlated, and both are dominated by level =3. 

###Basement variables

Similar the garage variables, multiple basement variables are important in the correlations matrix and the Top 20 RF predictors list. However, 11 basement variables seems an overkill. Before I decide what I am going to do with them, I am visualizing 8 of them below. The 2 "Bathroom" variables are dealt with in Feature Engineering (section 7.1), and the "Basement square feet" is already discussed in section 6.2.1.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
b1 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=BsmtFinSF1)) +
        geom_histogram() + labs(x='Type 1 finished square feet')
b2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=BsmtFinSF2)) +
        geom_histogram()+ labs(x='Type 2 finished square feet')
b3 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=BsmtUnfSF)) +
        geom_histogram()+ labs(x='Unfinished square feet')
b4 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(BsmtFinType1))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+ labs(x='Rating of Type 1 finished area')
b5 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(BsmtFinType2))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+ labs(x='Rating of Type 2 finished area')
b6 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(BsmtQual))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+ labs(x='Height of the basement')
b7 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(BsmtCond))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+ labs(x='Rating of general condition')
b8 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(BsmtExposure))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')+ labs(x='Walkout or garden level walls')

layout <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,9,6,7,8),3,3,byrow=TRUE)
multiplot(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, layout=layout)

```

So it seemed as if the Total Basement Surface in square feet (TotalBsmtSF) is further broken down into finished areas (2 if more than one type of finish), and unfinished area. I did a check between the correlation of total of those 3 variables, and TotalBsmtSF. The correlation is exactely 1, so that's a good thing (no errors or small discrepancies)!

Basement Quality is a confusing variable name, as it turns out that it specifically rates the Height of the basement.

#Feature engineering

##Total number of Bathrooms

There are 4 bathroom variables. Individually, these variables are not very important. However, I assume that I if I add them up into one predictor, this predictor is likely to become a strong one.

"A half-bath, also known as a powder room or guest bath, has only two of the four main bathroom components-typically a toilet and sink." Consequently, I will also count the half bathrooms as half.

```{r}
house$TotBathrooms <- house$FullBath + (house$HalfBath*0.5) + house$BsmtFullBath + (house$BsmtHalfBath*0.5)
```

As you can see in the first graph, there now seems to be a clear correlation (it's 0.63). The frequency distribution of Bathrooms in all data is shown in the second graph.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
tb1 <- ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=as.factor(TotBathrooms), y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
tb2 <- ggplot(data=house, aes(x=as.factor(TotBathrooms))) +
        geom_histogram(stat='count')
grid.arrange(tb1, tb2)

##Adding 'House Age', 'Remodeled (Yes/No)', and IsNew variables

Altogether, there are 3 variables that are relevant with regards to the Age of a house; YearBlt, YearRemodAdd, and YearSold. YearRemodAdd defaults to YearBuilt if there has been no Remodeling/Addition. I will use YearRemodeled and YearSold to determine the Age. However, as parts of old constructions will always remain and only parts of the house might have been renovated, I will also introduce a Remodeled Yes/No variable. This should be seen as some sort of penalty parameter that indicates that if the Age is based on a remodeling date, it is probably worth less than houses that were built from scratch in that same year.

```{r}
house$Remod <- ifelse(house$YearBuilt==house$YearRemodAdd, 0, 1) #0=No Remodeling, 1=Remodeling
house$Age <- as.numeric(house$YrSold)-house$YearRemodAdd
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=Age, y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
```

As expected, the graph shows a negative correlation with Age (old house are worth less).

```{r}
cor(house$SalePrice[!is.na(house$SalePrice)], house$Age[!is.na(house$SalePrice)])
```

As you can see below, houses that are remodeled are worth less indeed, as expected.

```{r, out.width="50%"}
ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=as.factor(Remod), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=6) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = comma) +
        theme_grey(base_size = 18) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed") #dashed line is median SalePrice
```

Finally, I am creating the IsNew variable below. Altogether, there are 116 new houses in the dataset.

```{r}
house$IsNew <- ifelse(house$YrSold==house$YearBuilt, 1, 0)
table(house$IsNew)
```

These 116 new houses are fairly evenly distributed among train and test set, and as you can see new houses are worth considerably more on average.

```{r, out.width="50%"}
ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=as.factor(IsNew), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=6) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = comma) +
        theme_grey(base_size = 18) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed") #dashed line is median SalePrice
```

```{r}
house$YrSold <- as.factor(house$YrSold) #the numeric version is now not needed anymore
```

##Binning Neighborhood

```{r}
nb1 <- ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=reorder(Neighborhood, SalePrice, FUN=median), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "median", fill='blue') + labs(x='Neighborhood', y='Median SalePrice') +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=3) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed", color = "red") #dashed line is median SalePrice
nb2 <- ggplot(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=reorder(Neighborhood, SalePrice, FUN=mean), y=SalePrice)) +
        geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = "mean", fill='blue') + labs(x='Neighborhood', y="Mean SalePrice") +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = comma) +
        geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count.., y = ..count..), size=3) +
        geom_hline(yintercept=163000, linetype="dashed", color = "red") #dashed line is median SalePrice
grid.arrange(nb1, nb2)
```

Both the median and mean Saleprices agree on 3 neighborhoods with substantially higher saleprices. The separation of the 3 relatively poor neighborhoods is less clear, but at least both graphs agree on the same 3 poor neighborhoods. Since I do not want to 'overbin', I am only creating categories for those 'extremes'.

```{r}
house$NeighRich[house$Neighborhood %in% c('StoneBr', 'NridgHt', 'NoRidge')] <- 2
house$NeighRich[!house$Neighborhood %in% c('MeadowV', 'IDOTRR', 'BrDale', 'StoneBr', 'NridgHt', 'NoRidge')] <- 1
house$NeighRich[house$Neighborhood %in% c('MeadowV', 'IDOTRR', 'BrDale')] <- 0
```

```{r}
table(house$NeighRich)
```

##Total Square Feet

As the total living space generally is very important when people buy houses, I am adding a predictors that adds up the living space above and below ground.

```{r}
house$TotalSqFeet <- house$GrLivArea + house$TotalBsmtSF
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=TotalSqFeet, y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma) +
        geom_text_repel(aes(label = ifelse(house$GrLivArea[!is.na(house$SalePrice)]>4500, rownames(house), '')))
```

As expected, the correlation with SalePrice is very strong indeed (0.78). 

```{r}
cor(house$SalePrice, house$TotalSqFeet, use= "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

The two potential outliers seem to 'outlie' even more than before. By taking out these two outliers, the correlation increases by 5%.

```{r}
cor(house$SalePrice[-c(524, 1299)], house$TotalSqFeet[-c(524, 1299)], use= "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

##Consolidating Porch variables

Below, I listed the variables that seem related regarding porches.


* WoodDeckSF: Wood deck area in square feet

* OpenPorchSF: Open porch area in square feet

* EnclosedPorch: Enclosed porch area in square feet

* 3SsnPorch: Three season porch area in square feet

* ScreenPorch: Screen porch area in square feet

        
As far as I know, porches are sheltered areas outside of the house, and a wooden deck is unsheltered. Therefore, I am leaving WoodDeckSF alone, and are only consolidating the 4 porch variables.

```{r}
house$TotalPorchSF <- house$OpenPorchSF + house$EnclosedPorch + house$X3SsnPorch + house$ScreenPorch
```

Although adding up these Porch areas makes sense (there should not be any overlap between areas), the correlation with SalePrice is not very strong.

```{r}
cor(house$SalePrice, house$TotalPorchSF, use= "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),], aes(x=TotalPorchSF, y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
```

#Preparing data for modeling

##Dropping highly correlated variables

First of all, I am dropping a variable if two variables are highly correlated. To find these correlated pairs, I have used the correlations matrix again (see section 6.1). For instance: GarageCars and GarageArea have a correlation of 0.89. Of those two, I am dropping the variable with the lowest correlation with SalePrice (which is GarageArea with a SalePrice correlation of 0.62. GarageCars has a SalePrice correlation of 0.64).

```{r}
dropVars <- c('YearRemodAdd', 'GarageYrBlt', 'GarageArea', 'GarageCond', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'TotalRmsAbvGrd', 'BsmtFinSF1')

house <- house[,!(names(house) %in% dropVars)]
```

##Removing outliers

For the time being, I am keeping it simple and just remove the two really big houses with low SalePrice manually. However, I intend to investigate this more thorough in a later stage (possibly using the 'outliers' package).

```{r}
house <- house[-c(524, 1299),]
```

##PreProcessing predictor variables

Before modeling I need to center and scale the 'true numeric' predictors (so not variables that have been label encoded), and create dummy variables for the categorical predictors. Below, I am splitting the dataframe into one with all (true) numeric variables, and another dataframe holding the (ordinal) factors.

```{r}
numericVarNames <- numericVarNames[!(numericVarNames %in% c('MSSubClass', 'MoSold', 'YrSold', 'SalePrice', 'OverallQual', 'OverallCond'))] #numericVarNames was created before having done anything
numericVarNames <- append(numericVarNames, c('Age', 'TotalPorchSF', 'TotBathrooms', 'TotalSqFeet'))

DFnumeric <- house[, names(house) %in% numericVarNames]

DFfactors <- house[, !(names(house) %in% numericVarNames)]
DFfactors <- DFfactors[, names(DFfactors) != 'SalePrice']

cat('There are', length(DFnumeric), 'numeric variables, and', length(DFfactors), 'factor variables')
```

###Skewness and normalizing of the numeric predictors

**Skewness**
Skewness is a measure of the symmetry in a distribution.  A symmetrical dataset will have a skewness equal to 0.  So, a normal distribution will have a skewness of 0. Skewness essentially measures the relative size of the two tails. As a rule of thumb, skewness should be between -1 and 1. In this range, data are considered fairly symmetrical. In order to fix the skewness, I am taking the log for all numeric predictors with an absolute skew greater than 0.8 (actually: log+1, to avoid division by zero issues).

```{r}
for(i in 1:ncol(DFnumeric)){
        if (abs(skew(DFnumeric[,i]))>0.8){
                DFnumeric[,i] <- log(DFnumeric[,i] +1)
        }
}
```

**Normalizing the data**
```{r}
PreNum <- preProcess(DFnumeric, method=c("center", "scale"))
print(PreNum)
```
```{r}
DFnorm <- predict(PreNum, DFnumeric)
dim(DFnorm)
```

###One hot encoding the categorical variables

The last step needed to ensure that all predictors are converted into numeric columns (which is required by most Machine Learning algorithms) is to 'one-hot encode' the categorical variables. This basically means that all (not ordinal) factor values are getting a seperate colums with 1s and 0s (1 basically means Yes/Present). To do this one-hot encoding, I am using the `model.matrix()` function.

```{r}
DFdummies <- as.data.frame(model.matrix(~.-1, DFfactors))
dim(DFdummies)
```

###Removing levels with few or no observations in train or test

In previous versions, I worked with Caret's `Near Zero Variance` function. Although this works, it also is a quick fix and too much information got lost. For instance, by using the defaults, all Neighborhoods with less than 146 houses are omitted as (one-hot encoded) variables (frequency ratio higher than 95/5). Therefore, I have taken amore carefull manual approach in this version.

```{r}
#check if some values are absent in the test set
ZerocolTest <- which(colSums(DFdummies[(nrow(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),])+1):nrow(house),])==0)
colnames(DFdummies[ZerocolTest])
DFdummies <- DFdummies[,-ZerocolTest] #removing predictors
```

```{r}
#check if some values are absent in the train set
ZerocolTrain <- which(colSums(DFdummies[1:nrow(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),]),])==0)
colnames(DFdummies[ZerocolTrain])
DFdummies <- DFdummies[,-ZerocolTrain] #removing predictor
```

Also taking out variables with less than 10 'ones' in the train set.

```{r}
fewOnes <- which(colSums(DFdummies[1:nrow(house[!is.na(house$SalePrice),]),])<10)
colnames(DFdummies[fewOnes])
DFdummies <- DFdummies[,-fewOnes] #removing predictors
dim(DFdummies)
```

Altogether, I have removed 49 one-hot encoded predictors with little or no variance. Altough this may seem a significant number, it is actually much less than the number of predictors that were taken out by using caret's`near zero variance` function (using its default thresholds).

```{r}
combined <- cbind(DFnorm, DFdummies) #combining all (now numeric) predictors into one dataframe 
```

##Dealing with skewness of response variable

```{r}
skew(house$SalePrice)
```

```{r}
qqnorm(house$SalePrice)
qqline(house$SalePrice)
```

The skew of 1.87 indicates a right skew that is too high, and the Q-Q plot shows that sale prices are also not normally distributed. To fix this I am taking the log of SalePrice.

```{r}
house$SalePrice <- log(house$SalePrice) #default is the natural logarithm, "+1" is not necessary as there are no 0's
skew(house$SalePrice)
```

As you can see,the skew is now quite low and the Q-Q plot is also looking much better.

```{r}
qqnorm(house$SalePrice)
qqline(house$SalePrice)
```

##Composing train and test sets

```{r}
train1 <- combined[!is.na(house$SalePrice),]
test1 <- combined[is.na(house$SalePrice),]
```

#Modeling

##Lasso regression model

I have also tried Ridge and Elastic Net models, but since lasso gives the best results of those 3 models I am only keeping the lasso model in the document.

The elastic-net penalty is controlled by alpha, and bridges the gap between lasso (alpha=1) and ridge (alpha=0). The tuning parameter lambda controls the overall strength of the penalty. It is known that the ridge penalty shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other while the lasso tends to pick one of them and discard the others.

Below, I am using caret cross validation to find the best value for lambda, which is the only hyperparameter that needs to be tuned for the lasso model.

```{r}
set.seed(27042018)
my_control <-trainControl(method="cv", number=5)
lassoGrid <- expand.grid(alpha = 1, lambda = seq(0.001,0.1,by = 0.0005))

lasso_mod <- train(x=train1, y=house$SalePrice[!is.na(house$SalePrice)], method='glmnet', trControl= my_control, tuneGrid=lassoGrid) 
lasso_mod$bestTune
min(lasso_mod$results$RMSE)
```

The documentation of the caret `varImp' function says: for glmboost and glmnet the absolute value of the coefficients corresponding to the tuned model are used.

Although this means that a real ranking of the most important variables is not stored, it gives me the opportunity to find out how many of the variables are not used in the model (and hence have coefficient 0).

```{r}
lassoVarImp <- varImp(lasso_mod,scale=F)
lassoImportance <- lassoVarImp$importance

varsSelected <- length(which(lassoImportance$Overall!=0))
varsNotSelected <- length(which(lassoImportance$Overall==0))

cat('Lasso uses', varsSelected, 'variables in its model, and did not select', varsNotSelected, 'variables.')
```

So lasso did what it is supposed to do: it seems to have dealt with multicolinearity well by not using about 45% of the available variables in the model.

```{r}
LassoPred <- predict(lasso_mod, test1)
predictions_lasso <- exp(LassoPred) #need to reverse the log to the real values
head(predictions_lasso)
length(predictions_lasso)
```

##XGBoost model

Initially, I just worked with the XGBoost package directly. The main reason for this was that the package uses its own efficient datastructure (xgb.DMatrix). The package also provides a cross validation function. However, this CV function only determines the optimal number of rounds, and does not support a full grid search of hyperparameters.

Although caret does not seem to use the (fast) datastructure of the xgb package, I eventually decided to do hyperparameter tuning with it anyway, as it at least supports a full grid search. As far as I understand it, the main parameters to tune to avoid overfitting are max_depth, and min_child_weight (see [XGBoost documentation](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/param_tuning.html)). Below I am setting up a grid that tunes both these parameters, and also the eta (learning rate).

```{r}
xgb_grid = expand.grid(
nrounds = 1000,
eta = c(0.1, 0.05, 0.01),
max_depth = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
gamma = 0,
colsample_bytree=1,
min_child_weight=c(1, 2, 3, 4 ,5),
subsample=1
)
```

The next step is to let caret find the best hyperparameter values (using 5 fold cross validation).

```{r}
#xgb_caret <- train(x=train1, y=house$SalePrice[!is.na(house$SalePrice)], method='xgbTree', trControl= my_control, tuneGrid=xgb_grid) 
#xgb_caret$bestTune
```

As expected, this took quite a bit of time (locally). As I want to limit the running time on Kaggle, I disabled the code, and am just continuing with the results. According to caret, the 'bestTune' parameters are:

* Max_depth=3
* eta=0.05
* Min_child_weight=4

In the remainder of this section, I will continue to work with the xgboost package directly. Below, I am starting with the preparation of the data in the recommended format.

```{r}
label_train <- house$SalePrice[!is.na(house$SalePrice)]

# put our testing & training data into two seperates Dmatrixs objects
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(train1), label= label_train)
dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(test1))
```

In addition, I am taking over the best tuned values from the caret cross validation.

```{r}
default_param<-list(
        objective = "reg:linear",
        booster = "gbtree",
        eta=0.05, #default = 0.3
        gamma=0,
        max_depth=3, #default=6
        min_child_weight=4, #default=1
        subsample=1,
        colsample_bytree=1
)
```

The next step is to do cross validation to determine the best number of rounds (for the given set of parameters). 

```{r}
xgbcv <- xgb.cv( params = default_param, data = dtrain, nrounds = 500, nfold = 5, showsd = T, stratified = T, print_every_n = 40, early_stopping_rounds = 10, maximize = F)
```

Although it was a bit of work, the hyperparameter tuning definitly paid of, as the cross validated RMSE inproved considerably (from 0.1225 without the caret tuning, to 0.1162 in this version)!

```{r}
#train the model using the best iteration found by cross validation
xgb_mod <- xgb.train(data = dtrain, params=default_param, nrounds = 454)
```

```{r}
XGBpred <- predict(xgb_mod, dtest)
predictions_XGB <- exp(XGBpred) #need to reverse the log to the real values
head(predictions_XGB)
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
#view variable importance plot
library(Ckmeans.1d.dp) #required for ggplot clustering
mat <- xgb.importance (feature_names = colnames(train1),model = xgb_mod)
xgb.ggplot.importance(importance_matrix = mat[1:20], rel_to_first = TRUE)
```

##Averaging predictions

Since the lasso and XGBoost algorithms are very different, averaging predictions likely improves the scores. As the lasso model does better regarding the cross validated RMSE score (0.1121 versus 0.1162), I am weigting the lasso model double.


```{r}
sub_avg <- data.frame(Id = test_labels, SalePrice = (predictions_XGB+2*predictions_lasso)/3)
head(sub_avg)
write.csv(sub_avg, file = 'Lasso.csv', row.names = F)
```
